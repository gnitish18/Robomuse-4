# helperScripts
This is a series of troubleshooting audio and pocketsphinx text-to-speech scripts. Was accumulated over a few months as I created my voice assistant and thought they would be helpful for others. 
1. audio_test.sh will test your audio input by recording a few second blurp from defaul system audio and then playing it back.
2. pyaudio_test.py will test that pyaudio is installed and working correctly.

I have also included some premade pocketsphinx models in the models/ dir and a simple always listening assistant/voice transcriber temaplte in Python.
